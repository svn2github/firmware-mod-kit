These packages have been custom tailored for the Firmware Modification Kit and DD-WRT, or have been otherwise certified to work correctly for current builds of DD-WRT.

If you find that the packages have an extra .BIN extension, ignore it. My web server doesn't have IPK registered as a MIME type, so I am forced to append .BIN to have it serve them up.
